# Remove the .bazeliskrc file from the smoke e2e so that the Bazel Central Registry
# CI doesn't attempt to use the Aspect CLI, which will fail for the Windows run since
# we don't publish Windows binaries. Two alternative solutions that were attempted but
# did NOT work:
#   1. In .bcr/presubmit.yml, override the env vars BAZELISK_BASE_URL and USE_BAZEL_VERSION
#   2. Add a Publish To BCR patch under .bcr/patches to remove the file. Worked on the BCR CI
#      on all platforms except for OSX where the patch command failed.

## Using Bzlmod with Bazel 6:

1. Enable with \`common --enable_bzlmod\` in \`.bazelrc\`.
2. Add to your \`MODULE.bazel\` file:

\`\`\`starlark
bazel_dep(name = "aspect_bazel_lib", version = "${TAG:1}")
\`\`\`

> Read more about bzlmod: <https://blog.aspect.dev/bzlmod>

## Using WORKSPACE

Paste this snippet into your \`WORKSPACE\` file:

\`\`\`starlark
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

http_archive(
    name = "aspect_bazel_lib",
    sha256 = "${SHA}",
    strip_prefix = "${PREFIX}",
    url = "https://github.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib/releases/download/${TAG}/${ARCHIVE}",
)

load("@aspect_bazel_lib//lib:repositories.bzl", "aspect_bazel_lib_dependencies", "aspect_bazel_lib_register_toolchains")

# Required bazel-lib dependencies

aspect_bazel_lib_dependencies()

# Register bazel-lib toolchains

aspect_bazel_lib_register_toolchains()
